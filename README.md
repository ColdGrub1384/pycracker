# pycracker
A cracker library, much like SentryMBA but with more utilities and uses.

It's  based of the idea to be able to use one cracker for everything. And that's what it is.
You can with this library modify it freely, but you may not sell it without giving proper credits.

The main idea is to have a pre-written library I can easily write a config for with a tiny amount of knowledge, 
basicly by looking at the examples provided.
But you can also get in deeper. You can re-write the functionality of it completely and make it use some other cracking technique.

You could also import it into another project easily and use the class. 

Possibilities are endless.
